# shell scripts / utilities

Decades worth of shell scrips. Mostly useful on custom tasks, shared
as a collection of tools, but really are backups to be used on disaster recovery.

A lot of useful stuff, but very specific to a particular system. Use caution.
Many of the scripts do what the name suggests, but there is no telling what impact
it my have on unexpected configurations. Again, caution.
